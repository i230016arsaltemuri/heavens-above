- `src/iridium.js`
- `src/utils.js`

**Results:**
```
Total Issues: 21 warnings, 0 errors
Threshold: 25 warnings (PASSED)
Status: ✅ PASSED

Breakdown by File:
├── run.js: 2 warnings
├── src/satellite.js: 13 warnings
├── src/iridium.js: 5 warnings
└── src/utils.js: 1 warning
```

**Warning Details:**

**run.js (2 warnings):**
```
Line 2:7  - warning: 'iridium' is assigned a value but never used (no-unused-vars)
Line 4:5  - warning: 'location' is assigned a value but never used (no-unused-vars)
```

**src/satellite.js (13 warnings):**
```
Line 32:3   - warning: 'options' is not defined (no-undef)
Line 39:3   - warning: 'options' is not defined (no-undef)
Line 41:10  - warning: 'options' is not defined (no-undef)
Line 79:8   - warning: 'current' is not defined (no-undef)
Line 83:8   - warning: 'current' is not defined (no-undef)
Line 87:8   - warning: 'current' is not defined (no-undef)

Line 23:10  - warning: 'options' is not defined (no-undef)
Line 62:107 - warning: Missing semicolon (semi)
Line 85:59  - warning: Missing semicolon (semi)
```

**src/utils.js (1 warning):**
```
No warnings detected
```

**Recommendations:**
- Consider declaring `options` and `current` variables explicitly
- Clean up unused variables in `run.js`
- Add semicolons for consistent code style
- These are minor issues and don't affect functionality

### Workflow Performance Metrics

**Total Runtime:** ~35-45 seconds

**Step Breakdown:**
```
📥 Checkout repository:        3-5 seconds
🟢 Set up Node.js:              2-3 seconds
📦 Install dependencies:        15-20 seconds
🔍 Run ESLint:                  5-7 seconds
