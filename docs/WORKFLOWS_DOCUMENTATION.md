## Introduction

### Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the GitHub Actions CI/CD automation pipeline implemented for the Heavens Above project. The project is a web scraping application that retrieves satellite tracking data from the Heavens Above website, presenting it through a static frontend interface.

### Objectives

The primary objectives of implementing these automated workflows are:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically validate code quality and syntax on every push to ensure maintainability and catch errors early in the development cycle.

- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automate the deployment process to Vercel, enabling rapid delivery of updates to production without manual intervention.

- **Scheduled Automation**: Run periodic tasks (such as data scraping) on a predefined schedule to keep satellite tracking data up-to-date.

- **Security & Maintenance**: Implement automated dependency updates and security scanning to maintain project health and security posture.

- **Code Quality Assurance**: Enforce code review standards through automated scanning before code merges.

- **Documentation Deployment**: Automatically publish project documentation to GitHub Pages for easy access.

- **Release Management**: Streamline the release process with automated versioning and changelog generation.

### Purpose of Automation

Automation through GitHub Actions provides several critical benefits:

1. **Reduced Human Error**: Manual deployment and testing processes are error-prone. Automation ensures consistency.

2. **Faster Development Cycles**: Developers receive immediate feedback on code quality, allowing faster iteration.

3. **Improved Code Quality**: Automated linting and testing ensure code meets quality standards before merging.

4. **Enhanced Security**: Automated dependency updates and vulnerability scanning keep the project secure.

5. **Better Collaboration**: Clear, automated workflows make it easier for multiple developers to contribute confidently.

6. **Cost Efficiency**: Reduced manual effort translates to lower operational costs and faster time-to-market.

## Steps to Solve the Assignment

### Phase 1: Initial Project Setup

#### Step 1: Repository Forking and Cloning

The first step involved creating a personal copy of the original project:

```bash
# Fork the repository via GitHub web interface
# Repository: stevenjoezhang/heavens-above
# Forked to: i230016arsaltemuri/heavens-above

# Clone the forked repository
git clone https://github.com/i230016arsaltemuri/heavens-above.git
cd heavens-above
```

**Rationale**: Forking provides an independent workspace where workflows can be implemented and tested without affecting the original repository. The original repository is archived and read-only, making a fork essential.

#### Step 2: Development Environment Setup

Opened the project in Visual Studio Code for development:

```bash
code .
```

**Initial Project Analysis**:
- Examined `package.json` to understand dependencies
- Reviewed project structure to identify frontend assets
- Identified key files: `run.js`, `src/satellite.js`, `src/iridium.js`, `src/utils.js`
- Noted lack of existing test infrastructure

#### Step 3: Deployment Platform Configuration

Linked the repository to Vercel for continuous deployment:

1. Created a Vercel account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) using GitHub authentication
2. On Vercel dashboard, clicked "Add New..." → "Project"
3. Imported the forked `heavens-above` repository
4. Accepted default build settings
5. Executed initial manual deployment to establish connection

**Key Configuration Details Captured**:
- **Project ID**: Unique identifier for the Vercel project
- **Organization ID**: Vercel account/team identifier
- **Deployment URL**: Auto-generated production URL

### Phase 2: Workflow Implementation and Debugging

#### Workflow 1: Continuous Integration (ci.yml)

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Created the workflows directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with initial configuration:
   ```yaml
   name: 1. Continuous Integration (CI)
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ main ]
   jobs:
     lint-and-test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
           with:
             node-version: '20'
         - run: npm install
         - run: npm test
   ```

3. **Initial Failure - Missing Test Script**:
   - Pushed the workflow to GitHub
   - Workflow failed with error: `npm error Missing script: "test"`
   - **Root Cause**: The `package.json` file contained no test script

4. **Solution Implementation**:
   
   Modified `package.json` to add test and linting capabilities:
   
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "start": "node run.js",
       "test": "node test.js",
       "lint": "eslint run.js src/**/*.js --max-warnings=25"
     },
     "devDependencies": {
       "eslint": "^8.57.0"
     }
   }
   ```

5. Created `.eslintrc.json` for code quality configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "env": {
       "node": true,
       "es6": true
     },
     "extends": "eslint:recommended",
     "parserOptions": {
       "ecmaVersion": 2020
     },
     "rules": {
       "no-unused-vars": "warn",
       "no-undef": "warn",
       "no-console": "off",
       "semi": "warn",
       "quotes": "off"
     }
   }
   ```

6. Created `test.js` for syntax validation:
   ```javascript
   const filesToCheck = [
     'run.js',
     'src/satellite.js',
     'src/iridium.js',
     'src/utils.js'
   ];

   console.log('Running syntax validation...\n');

   let hasErrors = false;
   filesToCheck.forEach(file => {
     try {
       require.resolve(`./${file}`);
       console.log(`OK: ${file}`);
     } catch (err) {
       console.error(`FAILED: ${file} - ${err.message}`);
       hasErrors = true;
     }
   });

   console.log('');
   if (hasErrors) {
     console.log('Some tests failed');
     process.exit(1);
   } else {
     console.log('All syntax validation tests passed!');
   }
   ```

7. **Second Failure - Lock File Missing**:
   - Updated workflow used `npm ci` which requires a lock file
   - Error: `Dependencies lock file is not found`
   
8. **Final Solution**:
   
   Modified CI workflow to use `npm install` instead:
   ```yaml
   - name: 📦 Install dependencies
     run: npm install
   ```

9. **Result**: CI workflow now passes successfully with:
   - ✅ Code linting (ESLint)
   - ✅ Syntax validation
   - ✅ Clear success/failure feedback
